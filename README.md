# Rosalind Solutions
Rosalind.info is a platform for learning about various algorithms used in the field of bioinformatics. 
Real world biology problems are explained, and the user is tasked with writing code that solves those problems.
These are the solutions I came up with.
This repository will be periodically updated as I finish more of the puzzles.
